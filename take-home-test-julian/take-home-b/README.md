# take-home-b

Thank you for taking the time to interview with Visitor Reach! Our team members are excited to see how you solve challenges and puzzles =)

Please spend some time solving the challenges in the repo.  You are welcome to spend as much time as you'd like, but it shouldn't take more than a few hours of your time on a weekend or during the week during after hours. Feel free to only complete the challenges you have time for.

Challenges are listed in order to ideally allow them to be built on each other as you progress but it's okay if you go out of order and complete some out of sequence.

There is no pass/fail score, this is more to allow our team members to see how you approach a problem and see what tools/tech you use to solve them.

For architecture diagrams, we recommend using Excalidraw for image generation but feel free to use whatever you feel is appropriate.

Be sure to include some tests, so we can see how you approach testing. With respect to programming languages, use either golang, python and/or javascript with a preference for python.  Some of the samples have been setup with python.

Any questions please let Raul know (raul@visitorreach.com). Also email Raul when you are done. We generally give candidates a week to work on and turn in their submissions but if you really need more time just ping Raul.

This repo will not be shared with other candidates so don't worry about checking in your API keys to some of the free to use services mentioned or just leave them out if you feel more comfortable that way too.

Thanks again and GOOD LUCK!
